DIV
In HTML, the <div> element is a container or a division that is 
used to group together other HTML elements and apply styles or scripts to them collectively.

SECTION
In HTML, the <section> element is a semantic HTML5 element that is used to define a section or
a thematic grouping of content within a document. It is typically employed to represent a part
of the document that is thematically related and can be considered as an independent unit.

'#' - ID selector 
A Class name can be used by multiple HTML elements, while an ID name must only be used by one HTML element within the page
